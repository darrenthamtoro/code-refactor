# code-refactor
In this project, you will have to edit the code of the html and css file in order to improve the website. The website should look the same, and the changes made to it is mostly to adjust all the contents in the website when the screen size changes. Many errors in the original code include paragraphs and words that go out of place when we shrink the screen, or the images that don't shrink according to screen size. After we're done editing the codes, we will submit 2 links to the course website BCS. The first is the URL of the deployed application and second is the URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README that describes the project.
